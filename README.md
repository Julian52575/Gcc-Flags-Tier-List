# Gcc Flags Tier List
### This is a tier list of some gcc flags.

## Notes 
1. The flags are not ordered within tiers. 
2. The flags might be ranked as a group like `includes` for `-iquote` and `-I`. 
3. The flags are taken from https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html and https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc. 

## Tiers :
* [S Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Provides essential features, coding in C would be more cumbersome or almost impossible without them. 
* [A Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) WIP
* [B Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) WIP
* [C Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) WIP
* [D Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) WIP

##### _This tier list is not meant to be taken seriously. I see this as a way to learn the internal of gcc._
