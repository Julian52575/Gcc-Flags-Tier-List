# Gcc Flags Tier List
## This is a tier list of all the gcc flags I found worthy enough[^1][^2].
### Flags are ordering with tiers, and then by appearance.    </h3>
### Meaning the _first flag of [S Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier)_ is the one I consider best while the _last of [D Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/D-Tier) is the worst_    
#### Summary :
1. [S Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) La crème de la crème, essential flags to use or at least consider using.
2. [A Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Solid flags, can proove themselves useful when no S tier do what they do.
3. [B Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Good flags, same idea as A tier but too niche to be A.
4. [C Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) These flags exists !
5. [D Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Flags that makes your life worse. Must only be used for pranking friend's Makefile or challenge runs.

You are free and encouraged to give your feedback under the 5th ammendment by creating an Issue on the relevant branch, let's _```make```_ this the ultimate collaborative tier list !





















[^1]: Note: This will focus manly on C related flags
[^2]: Note: There are **WAY** too many flags for me to realistically rate all of them before 2026
