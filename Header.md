# Gcc Flags Tier List
## This is a tier list of all the gcc flags I found worthy enough[^1][^2][^3].
<h3> Flags are ordering with tiers, and then by appearance.
  
Meaning the [first flag of S Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) is the one I consider best while the [last of D Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/D-Tier) is the worst</h3>

### Tiers :
* [S Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) La crème de la crème, essential flags to use or at least consider using.
* [A Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Solid flags, can proove themselves useful when the S tier department is lacking.
* [B Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Good flags, follow the same idea as A tier but too niche to be in it.
* [C Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) These flags exists !
* [D Tier](https://github.com/Julian52575/Gcc-Flags-Tier-List/tree/S-Tier) Flags that make your life worse. Must only be used for pranking friend's Makefile or challenge runs.
#### For each flag, I will provide a short description of its work, usage and my reasoning.    


##### You are free and encouraged to give your feedback under the 5th ammendment by creating an Issue on the relevant branch, let's _```make```_ this the ultimate collaborative tier list ! Have a good read !





















[^1]: Note: This will focus manly on C related flags
[^2]: Note: There are **WAY** too many flags for me to realistically rate all of them before 2026
[^3]: Note: This is only my humble opinion, do more constructive critisism and less death treat
